[{"content":" Definitions API\nAn application programming interface (API) is a formalized way of interacting with another piece of hardware or software without needing to know how that hardware or software actually works. As such, it is a convenient method of making requests to get, update, or push information between your system and the remote system. As a loose analogy, you can think of this as a menu in a resuraunt; you don\u0026rsquo;t need to know how the kitchen makes your food, but you need to know what you can ask for from your server. When you want scrambled eggs, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to go into the kitchen and make these from scratch, you simply put in a request based on the options on the menu.\nJSON\nJavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a method for storing and transmitting data primarily using key value pairs. It is compact, flexible, human readable, and works well in a Web based environment. It is generally the default format in which data is transmitted from an API.\nSet up The Abacus API is accessible through http, which means we can access the API using any http compliant tool, including a web browser.\nBy default, the API returns data in JSON notation. One of the issues we have when working in R is that R excels with rectangular data, especially if working in the Tidyverse. So we need to wrangle the JSON formatted data into a data structure more amenable to R. This begins by moving content into a list after which we can transition it to a dataframe, or tibble, as needed.\nTo do this all, we\u0026rsquo;ll use the following four libraries, although, as we\u0026rsquo;ll see later, we can get away with just the httr2 package:\n1 2 library(httr2) # http protocols library(jsonlite) # json to r data structures Steps In the proceding sections we\u0026rsquo;ll cover the following steps:\nUsing the search API to look for relevant datasets. Plugging a unique ID associated with the dataset(s) of interest into the datasets api to identify the files of interest. This involves first identifying a new unique ID for each dataset, only accessible through the datasets API, and the version of the dataset we\u0026rsquo;re interested in (an Abacus record is version controlled). We will then use the urls associated with the data files to download the relevant data. We will be working with the Statistics Canada Labour Force Surveys for this exercise.\nCaveats This is a simplified overview of API interactions. So, for example, we will not be doing any error handling, nor will we deal with using authentication tokens. But these are easily built in once the general approach is understood, and the httr2 package has functions for handling these things.\nBuilding the Connection Abacus is built on a Dataverse instance. You can refer to the Dataverse API documentation for more information on interacting with the API.\nAbacus has more than one API. This is common when interacting with APIs. Each API gives you access to certain functionalities and returns certain pieces of data. Here, we\u0026rsquo;ll review the search and datasets APIs; the former to locate content, the latter to retrieve that content. We will ultimately use the access API with download.file() to acquire the data.\nIn either case, we start with the base url into the API, which we\u0026rsquo;ll store in a variable.\n1 base_url \u0026lt;- \u0026#34;https://abacus.library.ubc.ca/api/\u0026#34; Next, we can add on the specific API we intend to search.\n1 search_api \u0026lt;- \u0026#34;search?q=\u0026#34; The search API requires a query parameter, ie, something to search for. This is articulated as a string, following the ?q=.\nNote: When using the httr2 package, if the query string is multi-word, spaces need to be filled with %20. For example, a search for labour force will fail, and need to be replaced with labour%20force.\nSearch API There are a variety of fields and file types that we can search through the search API, noting that, as a data repository, objects in Abacus are organized into dataverses, datasets, and files, where datasets reside in dataverses, and files within datasets. Datasets provide a high level overview of the data they hold, including descriptions, number of files, who produced the files, when they were uploaded, etc.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve already built our base_url and added on the requisite text to access the search API, search_api. We\u0026rsquo;ll now build our query, specifying the query and the file type of interest, ie, do we want to search for a dataverse, dataset, or file.\n1 2 search_query \u0026lt;- \u0026#34;title:labour\u0026#34; # retrieve everything with the word labour in the title search_type \u0026lt;- \u0026#34;\u0026amp;type=dataset\u0026#34; # limit to datasets We can then paste these together to construct a full query.\n1 (search_api_call \u0026lt;- paste0(base_url, search_api, search_query, search_type)) 1 ## [1] \u0026#34;https://abacus.library.ubc.ca/api/search?q=title:labour\u0026amp;type=dataset\u0026#34; To get a sense of what this looks like, we can load this query in our browser.\nImplementing the Search in R The hhtr2 package will allow us to make http requests from within R. The steps involved including:\na) building a request; and then b) performing that request, which results in some data being sent back to us.\nThese two steps are done, respectively, with the request() and req_perform() functions. We feed our search_api_call into the request() and then feed the result into the req_preform.\n1 2 3 search_resp \u0026lt;- search_api_call |\u0026gt; httr2::request() |\u0026gt; httr2::req_perform() What we get back is the same as what we saw in our browser, formatted as a list.\n1 str(search_resp) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 ## List of 7 ## $ method : chr \u0026#34;GET\u0026#34; ## $ url : chr \u0026#34;https://abacus.library.ubc.ca/api/search?q=title:labour\u0026amp;type=dataset\u0026#34; ## $ status_code: int 200 ## $ headers :List of 8 ## ..$ Date : chr \u0026#34;Tue, 08 Apr 2025 17:05:46 GMT\u0026#34; ## ..$ Server : chr \u0026#34;Apache/2.4.37 (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) OpenSSL/1.1.1k mod_R/1.2.9 R/3.5.0 mod_apreq2-20101207/2.8.1\u0026#34; ## ..$ X-Frame-Options : chr \u0026#34;SAMEORIGIN\u0026#34; ## ..$ Access-Control-Allow-Origin : chr \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; ## ..$ Access-Control-Allow-Methods: chr \u0026#34;PUT, GET, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS\u0026#34; ## ..$ Access-Control-Allow-Headers: chr \u0026#34;Accept, Content-Type, X-Dataverse-Key\u0026#34; ## ..$ Content-Type : chr \u0026#34;application/json;charset=UTF-8\u0026#34; ## ..$ Transfer-Encoding : chr \u0026#34;chunked\u0026#34; ## ..- attr(*, \u0026#34;class\u0026#34;)= chr \u0026#34;httr2_headers\u0026#34; ## $ body : raw [1:24063] 7b 22 73 74 ... ## $ request :List of 7 ## ..$ url : chr \u0026#34;https://abacus.library.ubc.ca/api/search?q=title:labour\u0026amp;type=dataset\u0026#34; ## ..$ method : NULL ## ..$ headers : list() ## ..$ body : NULL ## ..$ fields : list() ## ..$ options : list() ## ..$ policies: list() ## ..- attr(*, \u0026#34;class\u0026#34;)= chr \u0026#34;httr2_request\u0026#34; ## $ cache :\u0026lt;environment: 0x136290320\u0026gt; ## - attr(*, \u0026#34;class\u0026#34;)= chr \u0026#34;httr2_response\u0026#34; What we\u0026rsquo;re most interested in here is the body. However, the body is sent to us structured as json and in raw bytes. This is generally the case with an API response. httr2 has a built in function for converting the body from raw to something R can work with \u0026ndash; resp_body_json() \u0026ndash; and we\u0026rsquo;ll use this later, but we\u0026rsquo;ll start with the jsonlite package to explore this process step by step.\n1 summary(search_resp$body) 1 2 ## Length Class Mode ## 24063 raw raw Since we only want the body going forward, we\u0026rsquo;ll isolate this.\n1 search_body \u0026lt;- search_resp$body Data Wrangling Our first task is to convert this raw data to character data. We can do this with rawToChar.\n1 search_body_char \u0026lt;- rawToChar(search_body) We\u0026rsquo;re presented with a vector of length one, which if we print out the first bit of, does not look very friendly.\n1 summary(search_body_char) 1 2 ## Length Class Mode ## 1 character character 1 str(search_body_char) 1 ## chr \u0026#34;{\\\u0026#34;status\\\u0026#34;:\\\u0026#34;OK\\\u0026#34;,\\\u0026#34;data\\\u0026#34;:{\\\u0026#34;q\\\u0026#34;:\\\u0026#34;title:labour\\\u0026#34;,\\\u0026#34;total_count\\\u0026#34;:111,\\\u0026#34;start\\\u0026#34;:0,\\\u0026#34;spelling_alternatives\\\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;| __truncated__ This looks a little friendlier with cat()\n1 2 # not executed cat(search_body_char) Our next task then, is to convert this JSON notation to a suitable R data structure, in this case, a list.

This now looks almost identical to what we pulled up in our browser earlier. The actual relevant content is in the items list. But we\u0026rsquo;ll also need the total_count for when we need to request all the data from the server in a loop.

We should be able to do some evaluation with the name, description, fileCount, producers, published_at, url, and, for later retrieval, global_id. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at these quickly, noting importantly, that producers is another list, that we\u0026rsquo;ll need to wrangle some how.\n1 2 vars_of_interest \u0026lt;- c(\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;fileCount\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;producers\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;published_at\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;global_id\u0026#34;) lapply(search_data$items[vars_of_interest], class) # show the class of each list item 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 ## $name ## [1] \u0026#34;character\u0026#34; ## ## $description ## [1] \u0026#34;character\u0026#34; ## ## $fileCount ## [1] \u0026#34;integer\u0026#34; ## ## $producers ## [1] \u0026#34;list\u0026#34; ## ## $published_at ## [1] \u0026#34;character\u0026#34; ## ## $url ## [1] \u0026#34;character\u0026#34; ## ## $global_id ## [1] \u0026#34;character\u0026#34; Getting All the Data At this stage, we have what we need to pull search results from Abacus. You\u0026rsquo;ll note that the search returned a result set of 109, but only 10 items:\n1 (search_body_list$data$total_count) 1 ## [1] 111 1 (nrow(search_body_list$data$items)) 1 ## [1] 10 Going forward, we need to paginate through the result set to retrieve all the items.\nA few things to note:\nBy default, the search API returns 10 results per request. It allows for a maximum of 1000 per request. This is handled in the per_page parameter. There is a start parameter that we can feed into the request; this indicates which record to start retrieving data from. This number will need to be updated as we iterate over our requests, for example, if in the first call we pull records 1:1000, in the second call, we need to start at 1001. This is handled in the start parameter. R starts counting at 1, other languages start at 0, so the first record returned by the API is indexed at 0 on the server, not 1. APIs will have a limit on the number of requests you can make in any given time span. We\u0026rsquo;ll build in a simple delay using Sys.Sleep(), but httr2 has a built in function for handling this as well. Below is a function with the above steps built into it. It takes two arguments, a search string and the number of results to retrieve per request. It also prints some progress information to the console.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 search_datasets \u0026lt;- function(query, per_page) { # Build the query url \u0026lt;- paste0(\u0026#34;https://abacus.library.ubc.ca/api/search?q=\u0026#34;, query, \u0026#34;\u0026amp;type=dataset\u0026#34;) # Initial call to figure out total records resp \u0026lt;- url |\u0026gt; httr2::request() |\u0026gt; httr2::req_perform() resp_body \u0026lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(rawToChar(resp$body)) total_count \u0026lt;- resp_body$data$total_count # Give some feedback cat(paste0(\u0026#34;There are \u0026#34;, total_count, \u0026#34; records to be fetched.\\n\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Fetching \u0026#34;, per_page, \u0026#34; records per call.\\nThis will require \u0026#34;, ceiling(total_count/per_page), \u0026#34; calls.\\n\\n\u0026#34;)) # build place holders for loop name \u0026lt;- vector() description \u0026lt;- vector() file_count \u0026lt;- vector() producers \u0026lt;- list() pub_date \u0026lt;- vector() global_id \u0026lt;- vector() handle \u0026lt;- vector() # establish the starting point start_point \u0026lt;- 0 # create a counter for tracking calls call_counter \u0026lt;- 1 # run the loop while(length(handle) \u0026lt; total_count) { # while the number of retrieved records is \u0026lt; the total count cat(paste0(\u0026#34;Call \u0026#34;, call_counter, \u0026#34;\\n\u0026#34;)) # Indicate what call we\u0026#39;re on to the API req \u0026lt;- httr2::request(paste0(url, \u0026#34;\u0026amp;start=\u0026#34;, start_point, \u0026#34;\u0026amp;per_page=\u0026#34;, per_page)) # create the request resp \u0026lt;- httr2::req_perform(req) # perform the request resp_body \u0026lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(rawToChar(resp$body)) # convert the body from raw JSON to a list resp_body_name \u0026lt;- resp_body$data$items$name # get the name resp_body_desc \u0026lt;- resp_body$data$items$description # get the description resp_body_file_count \u0026lt;- resp_body$data$items$fileCount # get the file count resp_body_producers \u0026lt;- resp_body$data$items$producers # get the producers resp_body_handle \u0026lt;- resp_body$data$items$url #get the url resp_body_global_id \u0026lt;- resp_body$data$items$global_id # get id resp_body_pubdate \u0026lt;- resp_body$data$items$published_at # get update date # update the place holders: name \u0026lt;- c(name, resp_body_name) description \u0026lt;- c(description, resp_body_desc) file_count \u0026lt;- c(file_count, resp_body_file_count) producers \u0026lt;- c(producers, resp_body_producers) pub_date \u0026lt;- c(pub_date, resp_body_pubdate) handle \u0026lt;- c(handle, resp_body_handle) global_id \u0026lt;- c(global_id, resp_body_global_id) # update counters start_point \u0026lt;- start_point + per_page # increment the start_point call_counter \u0026lt;- call_counter + 1 # increment the counter Sys.sleep(.1) # pause before making a new call } # When all is said and done, compile the place holders into a list and return this object return(list(\u0026#34;name\u0026#34; = name, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34; = description, \u0026#34;file_count\u0026#34; = file_count, \u0026#34;producers\u0026#34; = producers, \u0026#34;pub_date\u0026#34; = pub_date, \u0026#34;handle\u0026#34; = handle, \u0026#34;global_id\u0026#34; = global_id)) } We can then call that function, here adding an additional parameter indicating that we only want to search the title and that we want 50 results per query.

In this post, I use simulated data to demonstrate issues that might arise with transforming data. I use a simulated dataset rather than an empirical one so we can compare the model results to the truth.\nImagine that a dangerous intersection has been causing frequent accidents between motored vehicles. A local group of concerned citizens decides to count the number of monthly accidents and report it to City Council. City Council decides to intervene by placing better street signs and lighting. The group of citizens then decided to count the number of accidents again to test whether or not there was an improvement in the number of accidents.\nFor the sake of this post, let\u0026rsquo;s assume that the mean number of accidents in the 12 months before the intervention was \\(\\lambda_0=2\\) per month. In the 12 months after the intervention, the mean number of monthly accidents decreases to \\(\\lambda_1 = 0.4\\). We can then simulate data for before and after the intervention as follows:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 library(\u0026#39;dplyr\u0026#39;) # for data wrangling library(\u0026#39;tidyr\u0026#39;) # for data wrangling library(\u0026#39;mgcv\u0026#39;) # for modeling library(\u0026#39;ggplot2\u0026#39;) # for fancy plots library(\u0026#39;gratia\u0026#39;) # for diagnostic plots in ggplot # change default ggplot theme theme_set(theme_bw() + theme(panel.grid = element_blank(), legend.position = \u0026#39;top\u0026#39;, text = element_text(face = \u0026#39;bold\u0026#39;))) set.seed(2024+10+7) # for reproducible results d \u0026lt;- expand_grid(month = 1:12, period = factor(c(\u0026#39;before\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;after\u0026#39;), levels = c(\u0026#39;before\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;after\u0026#39;))) %\u0026gt;% mutate(lambda = if_else(period == \u0026#39;before\u0026#39;, true = 2, false = 0.4), accidents = rpois(n = n(), lambda = lambda)) ggplot(d) + facet_wrap(~ period, ncol = 1) + geom_histogram(aes(accidents), binwidth = 1, fill = \u0026#39;grey\u0026#39;, color = \u0026#39;black\u0026#39;) + geom_vline(aes(xintercept = lambda), color = \u0026#39;darkorange\u0026#39;, lwd = 1) + labs(x = \u0026#39;Accidents per month\u0026#39;, y = \u0026#39;Count\u0026#39;) The distribution of the number of monthly accidents is clearly non-Gaussian both before and after the intervention. (Also note that the number of accidents cannot be negative.) Still, let\u0026rsquo;s fit a linear model to estimate the mean number of accidents in each period. In this post I use the mgcv::gam() function to fit all models for consistency and convenience, but note that you could also use the stats::lm() and stats::glm() functions, too. After fitting the model, we can look at the estimated change in mean accidents and appraise the model using diagnostic plots.\n1 2 m_1 \u0026lt;- gam(accidents ~ period, data = d) coef(m_1) 1 2 ## (Intercept) periodafter ## 1.666667 -1.250000 From the output of the coef() function, we can see that the estimated model is $$Y = 1.67 - 1.25\\,x_1,$$ where \\(x_1\\) is 0 for before the intervention and 1 for after. The periodafter coefficient indicates that there were -1.25 less accidents per month after the intervention. While this does not match the true effect of \\(2 - 0.4 = 1.6\\), we should expect some random variation, and the estimate is still reasonable. Longer observational periods would give us more accurate estimates.\n1 appraise(m_1, point_alpha = 0.3) Those who are used to looking at these plots may recognize two issues: (1) the residuals are not Gaussian (see the q-q plot and the histogram, in the left column), and (2) the variance in the observed values is lower when the predicted mean (linear predictor and fitted values) is lower. One may then decide to log-transform the number of accidents, after adding a small value to avoid taking the log of zero (since \\(\\log(0) = - \\infty\\)).\n1 2 3 4 # find proportion of months with no accidents d %\u0026gt;% group_by(period) %\u0026gt;% summarize(prop_zero = mean(accidents == 0)) 1 2 3 4 5 ## # A tibble: 2 × 2 ## period prop_zero ## \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 before 0.167 ## 2 after 0.667 1 2 3 4 # add a variable of log(accidents + 1) d$log1p_accidents \u0026lt;- log1p(d$accidents) m_2 \u0026lt;- gam(log1p_accidents ~ period, data = d) coef(m_2) 1 2 ## (Intercept) periodafter ## 0.8620910 -0.5972532 1 appraise(m_2, point_alpha = 0.3) The log1p transformation resulted in a somewhat more symmetrical distribution of residuals, and the mode of the distribution is closer to zero, and improved the issue of non-constant variance (heteroskedasticity). The coefficients are also harder to interpret because they are on the log1p scale, since the model is $$\\log(Y+1)=0.86 - 0.60 \\,x_1.$$\nRather than forcing our response variable to be Gaussian when it isn\u0026rsquo;t (see this modeling workshop I created with the CSC), we can fit a model that fits our data well: a Generalized Linear Model (GLM). GLMs allow one to recognize the structure of the response variable (e.g., any bounds and the mean-variance relationship) by specifying an appropriate statistical distribution (e.g., Gaussian, binomial, etc.).\nThe Poisson distribution is a good option because it represents the number of events that occur within a given period of time and location. We can fit a Poisson GLM by specifying the family in the gam() function:\n1 2 m_3 \u0026lt;- gam(accidents ~ period, data = d, family = poisson(link = \u0026#39;log\u0026#39;)) coef(m_3) 1 2 ## (Intercept) periodafter ## 0.5108256 -1.3862944 1 appraise(m_3, point_alpha = 0.3) The output from coef() tells us that the GLM is $$\\lambda = e{0.51-1.39\\,x_1}.$$ This means that after the intervention, the number of accidents decreased to \\(e^-1.39 * 100%= 0.25%\\) what they were in the 12 months before.\nWith the GLM, we can see a improvement in both the q-q plot and histogram of residuals, and while the variance still increases with the mean number of accidents, the model now expects that to be the case. This is because the variance of a Poisson distributions is equal to its mean, both of which are usually indicated as \\(\\lambda\\) rather than \\(\\lambda\\).\nThe \\(\\log\\) link function (link = 'log') allows us to create a model that will only give us non-negative numbers of accidents by having the form $$\\log(\\lambda) = 0.51-1.39 \\, x_1,$$ which we can re-write as $$\\lambda = e^{ 0.51-1.39 \\, x_1}.$$ Notice that while this model may look similar to the log1p model, the \\(\\log\\) function is applied to \\(\\lambda\\), the mean of \\(Y\\), rather than to \\(Y\\) directly. This is important because it removes the systematic bias that results from applying non-linear transformations such as \\(\\log(Y)\\), \\(\\sqrt{Y}\\), and \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\sqrt{Y}\\right)\\) to a random variable. Now that we have three models, let\u0026rsquo;s compare between the predictions that the tree give us:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 # predictions pred \u0026lt;- function(model, model_type) { p \u0026lt;- predict(model, newdata = newdata, se.fit = TRUE) %\u0026gt;% as.data.frame() p \u0026lt;- p %\u0026gt;% transmute( model = model_type, # get predictions and approximate 95% Bayesian Credible Intervals est = case_when(model == \u0026#39;LM\u0026#39; ~ fit, grepl(\u0026#39;log1p\u0026#39;, model) ~ exp(fit) - 1, model == \u0026#39;Poisson GLM\u0026#39; ~ exp(fit)), lwr_95 = case_when(model == \u0026#39;LM\u0026#39; ~ fit - 1.96 * se.fit, grepl(\u0026#39;log1p\u0026#39;, model) ~ exp(fit - 1.96 * se.fit) - 1, model == \u0026#39;Poisson GLM\u0026#39; ~ exp(fit - 1.96 * se.fit)), upr_95 = case_when(model == \u0026#39;LM\u0026#39; ~ fit + 1.96 * se.fit, grepl(\u0026#39;log1p\u0026#39;, model) ~ exp(fit + 1.96 * se.fit) - 1, model == \u0026#39;Poisson GLM\u0026#39; ~ exp(fit + 1.96 * se.fit))) %\u0026gt;% bind_cols(newdata, .) %\u0026gt;% mutate(x = paste(period, model)) p } newdata \u0026lt;- tibble(period = unique(d$period)) preds \u0026lt;- bind_rows( pred(model = m_1, model_type= \u0026#39;LM\u0026#39;), pred(model = m_2, model_type= \u0026#39;LM of log1p\u0026#39;), pred(model = m_3, model_type= \u0026#39;Poisson GLM\u0026#39;)) ggplot() + facet_wrap(~ period, nrow = 1) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \u0026#39;grey\u0026#39;) + geom_hline(aes(yintercept = lambda), color = \u0026#39;black\u0026#39;, d, lty = \u0026#39;dashed\u0026#39;) + geom_jitter(aes(\u0026#39;LM of log1p\u0026#39;, accidents), d, alpha = 0.3, height = 0) + geom_errorbar(aes(model, ymin = lwr_95, ymax = upr_95, color = model), preds, alpha = 0.3, width = 0) + geom_point(aes(model, est, color = model), preds) + labs(x = NULL, y = \u0026#39;Number of accidents\u0026#39;) + khroma::scale_color_highcontrast(name = \u0026#39;Model\u0026#39;) From the plot above, we can see that the LM and GLM have fairly similar coefficient estimates and that the log1p LM resulted in lower estimates for both. This is due to a systematic bias that occurs when one applies a nonlinear transformation to a random variable, like \\(\\log(Y)\\). I explain why in the sections below. Additionally, while the LM\u0026rsquo;s coefficients are reasonable, the 95% Bayesian Credible Intervals (BCIs) for the post-intervention estimate are not appropriate because they include negative values. In contrast, the GLM\u0026rsquo;s BCIs are asymmetric: they are shorter below the mean and longer above the mean. This is recognizes that a multiplicative change for large values is larger than one for small values: a 50% decrease will take 2 to 1 and take 4 to 2. Consequently, asymmetric BCIs provide a better representation of the model\u0026rsquo;s uncertainty.\nLinear and nonlinear transformations I want to end this section by explaining the difference between linear and nonlinear transformations and how the two impact modeling. Linear transformations include all transformations that can be written as a series of additions, subtractions, multiplications, or divisions. Formally, they have the form \\(Y_t = (aY + b)\\), where \\(Y\\) is our original response variable of interest, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are any number (but \\(a \\ne 0\\)), and \\(Y_t\\) is the transformed response. These transformations are called \u0026ldquo;linear\u0026rdquo; because the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division only shift distributions left and right (addition and subtraction) or expand and shrink distributions (multiplication and division), so \\(Y_t\\) and \\(Y\\) follow a linear relationship for any finite and nonzero value of \\(a\\) and any finite value of \\(b\\):\n1 2 Y \u0026lt;- seq(0.01, 2, by = 1e-3) ggplot() + geom_line(aes(Y, Y/10 + 3)) Conversely, nonlinear transformations are all transformations that cannot be written using only addition, subtraction, multiplications, or division. If we were to plot any of these functions, we would see a nonlinear relationship between the original and transformed values:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 expand_grid(Y = Y, trans = c(\u0026#39;Y / 10 + 3\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;log(Y)\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;sqrt(Y)\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;arcsin(sqrt(Y))\u0026#39;)) %\u0026gt;% mutate( Y_star = case_when(trans == \u0026#39;Y / 10 + 3\u0026#39; ~ Y/10 + 3, trans == \u0026#39;log(Y)\u0026#39; ~ log(Y), trans == \u0026#39;sqrt(Y)\u0026#39; ~ sqrt(Y), trans == \u0026#39;arcsin(sqrt(Y))\u0026#39; ~ asin(sqrt(Y)))) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(Y, Y_star)) + facet_wrap(~ trans, scales = \u0026#39;free_y\u0026#39;) + geom_line() + labs(x = \u0026#39;Y\u0026#39;, y = expression(bold(Y[t]))) 1 2 3 4 ## Warning: There was 1 warning in `mutate()`. ## ℹ In argument: `Y_star = case_when(...)`. ## Caused by warning in `asin()`: ## ! NaNs produced Jensen\u0026rsquo;s inequality Jensen\u0026rsquo;s inequality demostrates that if we apply a nonlinear transformation to a random variable, we can\u0026rsquo;t simply back-transform the mean. This is because, if \\(g()\\) is a nonlinear transformation and \\(g^{-1}()\\) is its inverse (e.g, \\(g() = \\log()\\) and \\(g^{-1}()=\\exp()\\)): $$g\\big[\\mathbb E(Y)\\big] \\ne \\mathbb E\\big[g(Y)\\big],$$ where \\(\\mathbb E()\\) indicates an expected value such that \\(\\mathbb E(Y)=\\mu\\). This implies that $$\\mathbb E(Y) = \\mu \\ne g^{-1}\\bigg\\{\\mathbb E\\big[g(Y)\\big]\\bigg\\}.$$\nHere is a graphical example to help you visualize why. The green vertical line is the estimated mean (i.e., what we\u0026rsquo;re usually interested in), the blue line is the estimated mean of the square-root transformed \\(Y\\), and the blue line is the back-transformed estimated mean of the square-root transformed \\(Y\\). The black line is the estimated bias.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 set.seed(2024-10-7) Y \u0026lt;- rpois(n = 250, lambda = 1) ggExtra::ggMarginal( ggplot() + geom_line(aes(seq(0, ceiling(max(Y)), by = 0.01), y = sqrt(after_stat(x))), color = \u0026#39;grey\u0026#39;) + geom_jitter(aes(Y, sqrt(Y)), height = 0.02, alpha = 0.3) + geom_vline(aes(color = \u0026#39;estimated~E(Y)\u0026#39;, xintercept = mean(Y)), lwd = 1) + geom_hline(aes(color = \u0026#39;estimated~E(sqrt(Y))\u0026#39;, yintercept = mean(sqrt(Y))), lwd = 1) + geom_vline(aes(color = \u0026#39;estimated~(E(sqrt(Y)))^2\u0026#39;, xintercept = mean(sqrt(Y))^2), lwd = 1) + geom_segment(aes(x = mean(sqrt(Y))^2, xend = mean(Y), y = 0.5, yend = 0.5), arrow = grid::arrow(ends = \u0026#39;both\u0026#39;, length = unit(0.1, \u0026#39;in\u0026#39;))) + labs(x = \u0026#39;Y\u0026#39;, y = expression(bold(sqrt(Y)))) + khroma::scale_color_bright(name = \u0026#39;Variable\u0026#39;, labels = scales::parse_format()) + theme(legend.position = \u0026#39;inside\u0026#39;, legend.position.inside = c(0.8, 0.2), legend.frame = element_rect(fill = \u0026#39;black\u0026#39;)), fill = \u0026#39;grey\u0026#39;, type = \u0026#39;histogram\u0026#39;, xparams = list(bins = 5), yparams = list(bins = 5)) However, note that the transformations only cause bias if applied to random variables. You can apply nonlinear transformations to predictor variables that you assume are measured exactly right. This means that fitting a model of the form \\(Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log(x_1)\\) will not cause issues if you assume \\(x_1\\) is exactly correct with no error (as we often assume). Applying nonlinear transformations on predictors can be useful when a predictor has a distribution with a very long tail, or if one wants to create a variable with diminishing effects (e.g., moving closer to something matters more when you\u0026rsquo;re close and less when you\u0026rsquo;re already far from it). I will make a blog post on this in the future.\nReferences Whitlock M. \u0026amp; Schluter D. (2020). Analysis of biological data, Third edition.

It is commonly used for in research to make files accessible, including code, data, models, and figures. Sharing code and data through platforms like GitHub helps make research more transparent, reproducible, and credible Braga et al. 2023. In this blog post, I will show you how to create your first GitHub repository (\u0026ldquo;repo\u0026rdquo; for short), how to set up a convenient folder structure, and how to push (i.e., upload) and pull (i.e., download) content to and from the repo. The Center for Scholarly Communication (CSC) also runs a two-part workshop on how to use GitHub. The material is available on the CSC website: Part 1 and Part 2.\nBefore we start, you will need to download and install GitHub Desktop from https://desktop.github.com/download/. While it installs, make an account on github.com if you don\u0026rsquo;t have one already.\nTo make your first repo, go to File/New repository or press Ctrl + N.\nNow choose your repo\u0026rsquo;s name. Something short and simple, like my-first-repo works for now. If you want, you can also add a description of the repo\u0026rsquo;s contents and change the location of the local copy that GitHub Desktop will make. On my personal machine, I tend to save repos in Documents/GitHub, but on my lab machine I save them in my UBC home drive: H:/GitHub. If you are planning on working primarily with only one language (e.g., R or Python), I would suggest choosing the appropriate Git ignore. This will hide files that you generally don\u0026rsquo;t want to push to GitHub (e.g., .Rhistory and .RData files). You can change the .gitignore files later with any text editor. The last step here is to choose a license. If you want a simple open-access licence for code, the MIT one is a good option.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve now created your first GitHub repo, but it is currently only on your local machine. To push it to GitHub, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to publish the repo (top ribbon, to the right). Before confirming, you can:\nupdate the name (this won\u0026rsquo;t change the name of the folder on your machine), edit the description, decide whether you want the repo to be public or not (it\u0026rsquo;s private by default), and choose if you want to add it into an existing organization (e.g., your lab\u0026rsquo;s organization). Be careful though \u0026ndash; it can be hard to edit the repo after you\u0026rsquo;ve added it to an organization. Now that the repo is on GitHub, you can start pushing and pulling content to and from it. As a general rule, you should always check for any updates by pulling (click Fetch-origin followed by Pull origin) before trying to push anything, otherwise GitHub will have to manage the pull/push conflict by merging the old files (to be pulled) with the new ones (to be pushed). This can be quite confusing, so it\u0026rsquo;s always good to make to pull first (even if you\u0026rsquo;re the only one working on the repo on two machines). Once you have some files you want to push to the repo, select the ones you want to push by clicking on the boxes in the upper left, add a summary for the commit (i.e., the series of changes to push) at the bottom of the column. Commit summaries should be brief and simple but clear, like \u0026ldquo;cleaned data and started model fitting\u0026rdquo;. You can use markdown in both the summary and the description (see the field below the summary field) for messages like \u0026ldquo;removed unnecessary library() calls\u0026rdquo; using \\(\\text{text}\\). In the changes column, green \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; symbols indicate new files, yellow dots indicate changed files, and red \u0026ldquo;-\u0026rdquo; symbols indicate file deletions. The panel on the right will show you exactly what portions of a file you changed, if the file is a simple text file (e.g., .csv., .R, .Rmd, .md, and .txt, but not .pdf, .doc, .ppt, or .rds). Consequently, GitHub\u0026rsquo;s version control and edit history work best if you use simple text files as much as possible. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve committed all your changes, don\u0026rsquo;t forget to push the changes to GitHub using the \u0026ldquo;Push origin\u0026rdquo; button! You can check the status of your changes by going to GitHub and navigating to your repo.\nReferences Braga P.H.P., Hébert K., Hudgins E.J., Scott E.R., Edwards B.P.M., Sánchez Reyes L.L., et al.

A good example of this is conversion between scales. If we wanted to change a measurement from metres to kilometres or weight in pounds to kilograms, we could do this simply by performing a basic operation on an entire column. In this situation, let’s start by multiplying two columns together to create a new column. Recall the GDP dataset from previous articles. Let’s say we want to know the total GDP for the country. This could be calculated by multiplying the population by the GDP_per_Cap.\nIf you are just starting here, let’s re-load in the Gapminder data that we have been using in previous posts:\n1 2 link \u0026lt;- \u0026#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jstaf/gapminder/master/gapminder/gapminder.csv\u0026#39; df \u0026lt;- read.csv(url(link)) 1 2 df$Total_GDP \u0026lt;- df$pop * df$gdpPercap head(df) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ## country continent year lifeExp pop gdpPercap Total_GDP ## 1 Afghanistan Asia 1952 28.801 8425333 779.4453 6567086330 ## 2 Afghanistan Asia 1957 30.332 9240934 820.8530 7585448670 ## 3 Afghanistan Asia 1962 31.997 10267083 853.1007 8758855797 ## 4 Afghanistan Asia 1967 34.020 11537966 836.1971 9648014150 ## 5 Afghanistan Asia 1972 36.088 13079460 739.9811 9678553274 ## 6 Afghanistan Asia 1977 38.438 14880372 786.1134 11697659231 Since the number is too large to actually interpret, let’s divide it by 1 billion so that the unit of measure is in billions.

This is a useful tool if you had information where a first name and last name were separated, or even there was a username and you wanted to create a new column by combining the username and an email extension. Let’s take a look at our example.\n1 2 df$Country_Cont \u0026lt;- paste(df$country, \u0026#39;_\u0026#39;, df$continent) head(df) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 ## country continent year lifeExp pop gdpPercap TotalGDP_Bil ## 1 Afghanistan Asia 1952 28.801 8425333 779.4453 6.567086 ## 2 Afghanistan Asia 1957 30.332 9240934 820.8530 7.585449 ## 3 Afghanistan Asia 1962 31.997 10267083 853.1007 8.758856 ## 4 Afghanistan Asia 1967 34.020 11537966 836.1971 9.648014 ## 5 Afghanistan Asia 1972 36.088 13079460 739.9811 9.678553 ## 6 Afghanistan Asia 1977 38.438 14880372 786.1134 11.697659 ## Country_Cont ## 1 Afghanistan _ Asia ## 2 Afghanistan _ Asia ## 3 Afghanistan _ Asia ## 4 Afghanistan _ Asia ## 5 Afghanistan _ Asia ## 6 Afghanistan _ Asia There are so many different ways to perform an operation like this.\nAs an exercise, try creating your own column using either a basic mathematical operation on an existing column, or by combining two columns, or anything else you can think of!\nSome examples:\nCreate a new column with the first three letters of the country name Create a column to show TRUE if the TotalGDP_Bil is greater than 5, FALSE if not.

They have a lot of similarities, but there are also many differences.\nThe purpose of this post is to help students to decide which language to learn first, according to their differences, similarities, and departmental practices.\nFirst, let\u0026rsquo;s introduce each, and talk about their main purposes.\nIntroducing Python Python is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. It was created in 1991, and it has a community of people who contribute to regularly updating libraries and improving efficiencies. It happens to be one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Some of the most common libraries for data-related tasks include NumPy (for arrays), Pandas (for data analysis and manipulation), and MatPlotLib (for data visualizations). Python is a powerful tool used for machine learning, deep learning, and modelling. Jupyter Notebook is a useful interface to pair with Python because it allows for clean, readable layouts to be shared with peers and users. Note that Jupyter Notebook also supports R.\nPython is commonly used in disciplines such as computer science, data science, mathematics (optimization, pure math, finance, economics, etc.), physics, engineering, the social sciences, and more. Note that this is just a general consensus. Your specific department at UBC, or your previous institution, may have done something differently.\nIntroducing R R was originally created for statistics, specializing in statistical analysis and visualization. R was created in 1993, but generally has less community support and less advancements than Python. This is one of the major complaints of users, and is one reason why many people end up turning to Python over R. Libraries and tools in R are best known for helping with tasks such as cleaning data, creating visualization, and training some machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Note that R can take significantly longer to handle machine learning algorithms than alternatives such as Python.\nR is commonly used in disciplines such as biology and math (statistics). Again, this is just a general consensus, and your specific department may use a different tool.\nSimilarities Both R and Python are open source programming languages that are maintained and supported by large communities.\nDifferences Here, we will discuss some of the differences between R and Python, which can help to decide which to start learning first.\nR is mainly used for statistical analysis, but Python is traditionally better for data wrangling. Python is more multi-purpose, and these skills can be transferable to other things, such as web development or application development. Python has a readable syntax that is easier to learn.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take a look at this chart below to look at more differences between the two.\nR Python mainly used for statistical analysis | - better for data wrangling leans towards statistical modelling and analytics | - more multi-purpose (can transfer skills to application or web development) can perform deep statistical analysis in short code chunks | - more readable syntax data visualizations can be built from models with ggplot2 | - scalable for machine learning and data analysis, Altair has interactive and customizable visualizations only supports data formats from Excel, CSV, txt files | - supports many data formats (CSV, JSON, SQL tables, web requested data, etc.) optimized for statistical analysis of large datasets | - Pandas let\u0026rsquo;s you filter and sort data almost instantly modelling analysis requires non-core R (tidyverse used for importing, visualizing, reporting, etc.) | - standard libraries used work together well (NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn) General Preferences In general, it is commonly considered that if you have programming experience, Python is the way to go, because it is a very easy language to learn (compared to others). If you are new to programming, Python is also considered a great learning language for beginners, and R may take some extra efforts to develop expertise.\nIf your team or supervisor prefers one language over another, it is usually easier to stick with what the people around you are using. This will allow them to help you if you run into issues. Talk to your team to find out what the majority of them prefer to use.\nOverall, R is better for statistical learning, and Python is better for machine learning, large-scaled apps, and data analysis within the web and its applications. Python and R both have great visualization tools, and you can read posts about those here as well, so visualizations shouldn\u0026rsquo;t prevent you from deciding between the two.\nR and Python are both wonderful tools to have in your toolbox for all academic and professional endeavours. When in doubt, just learn both! But if you don\u0026rsquo;t have the time, hopefully this information helps to make a more informed decision. It is also easier to learn one if you already have familiarity with the other, so feel free to keep the door open to return to learning the other option down the road.\n","date":"2023-07-26T09:00:00-08:00","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/csc-blog-new/p/python-vs-r-how-to-decide/","title":"Python vs R - How To Decide?"},{"content":"As we know, Jupyter Notebook can be used easily with our UBC login information via Syzygy. Jupyter Notebook can also be downloaded to a computer and used via Anaconda. There are many different interfaces that allow us to use Python. One of the more interesting ones to note is actually RStudio. There is a package in R called reticulate that allows us to create an RMarkdown file and use both R and Python code chunks within the same file. This is actually how this blog is able to show both R and Python content! Let\u0026rsquo;s get started on how reticulate is used in RStudio to include Python code.\nInstallation First, installation is required. To install the reticulate package in RStudio from CRAN, type the following:\n1 install.packages(\u0026#34;reticulate\u0026#34;) Python Version Next, we need to access the version of Python desired. Reticulate will, by default, find and use the version of Python via PATH. To check this, type Sys.which(\u0026quot;python\u0026quot;).\nIf you would like to change the version to something other than what is found in PATH, try the use_python() function. Here is an example of how to call the package from the library, and then use a different path to get to the desired Python version.\n1 2 library(reticulate) use_python(\u0026#34;/my/file/path/python\u0026#34;) Getting Started Now that the reticulate package has been installed, we can start using Python within an RMarkdown document.\nOnce an RMarkdown file has been started, create a new code block. Note that on a Windows, a shortcut for adding a new code block is Ctrl+alt+i. Once a new code block appears, it should look like this:\nIf you were to type code here, it would be in R. To change it to Python, simply replace the \u0026lsquo;r\u0026rsquo; with \u0026lsquo;python\u0026rsquo;. Then it will look like this:\nNow, the console below will change to show Python code once something in this block is run. You can easily switch back and forth between R and Python from code chunk to code chunk.\nYou can also see your saved variables in the environment, separated between R and Python. Note that when you do something such as import a dataset, if you wanted to perform manipulations on the dataset in both R and Python, you will have to load the dataset in using both R and Python, and it will create separate variables which do not override each other. They will stay speparate in the environment.\nTo change between R and Python environments, go to the Environment window and click the dropdown arrow. It should look like this:\nIf you would like to see some examples, take a look at the _src folder in the GitHub repo for this blog to see how each of the posts are created in both R and Python.

We can write our own functions, but generally in Python we’ll be using functions that have already been written or built.\nSimple functions can be in base Python or in different packages. Take these base Python functions for example:\n1 sum((1,1)) 1 ## 2 1 max([1, 2, 5, 8, 3]) 1 ## 8 Calling a function requires 2 things: the function itself and any arguments the function allows us to specify – one of these arguments is the data source, but there are usually other parameters we can specify.\nIf we want to understand how the built-in functions work, let’s define our own function for addition. We start by naming it, and then defining the arguments. Here, let\u0026rsquo;s call it \u0026lsquo;add\u0026rsquo; and it will take in two numbers, so we set the arbitrary names of these arguments to x and y.\n1 2 3 4 5 def add(x,y): answer = x + y return answer add(1,1) 1 ## 2 This is cool, but unnecessary work. It’s much easier to use the built-in function that we use above. This is why packages are so useful. Other people have spent time defining functions to do typical tasks, so we can use the existing work rather than duplicating effort.\nNote that there may be limitations or unexpected behaviours to a function. What would happen if we added x+y in this function?\n1 add(\u0026#39;x\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;y\u0026#39;) 1 ## \u0026#39;xy\u0026#39; This is something to consider when creating functions! It may not always be used for its intended use.\nIf we wanted to create a function to reverse a number, we could do that first by defining the name of our function, as well as how many arguments it requires.

Let’s imagine Python as a base version. It can do basic calculations, but it requires extra efforts to do more complicated things. People have created extras or add-ons to help create shortcuts for more complicated specific tasks or functions. These ‘add-ons’ are called modules. A module allows us to use already defined classes, functions, variables, and more. Packages are a collection of similar modules. These modules are stored together in a package to help with storage and ease of use.\nPackages can be imported to use to help make things easier. For example, there is a Python package called math that helps with basic mathematical operations.\nTo use a package or specific module within it, we use the import command. The format of these commands is as followed:\nimport package.subpackage.modulename\nWe can also nickname the packages to make it easier when we use them. This is done using the as statement. An example of this is import pandas as pd. By doing this, whenever a function from pandas is used, instead of having to type pandas.function_name, we can type pd.function_name. This may not seem like a big difference, but when it is used repeatedly, this can save a lot of time and effort.\nA few of the main packages used in python include:\nPackage Name Usage Standard Import Command NumPy Used for arrays, matricies and mathematical functions import numpy as np pandas Used with data frames import pandas as pd matplotlib Typically used for plotting functions from matplotlib import pyplot as plt altair More advanced plotting options import altair as alt SciPy Used for scientific and technical computing import scipy There are many other packages available, and you can even create your own as well!

Data Frames A data frame essentially functions as a series of connected vectors or lists, where each vector or list is a column. In this sense a data frame is also a special kind of list.\nIn a data frame, all vectors need to be of the same length. And while each vector must hold the same data type, not all vectors need to be of the same data type. Data frames also allow us to apply column names.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at an example of creating a dataframe from two lists.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 letter_list = [\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;b\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;d\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;e\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;f\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;g\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;h\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;] number_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] import pandas as pd df = pd.DataFrame( {\u0026#39;Letters\u0026#39;: letter_list, \u0026#39;Numbers\u0026#39;: number_list}) df 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ## Letters Numbers ## 0 a 1 ## 1 b 2 ## 2 c 3 ## 3 d 4 ## 4 e 5 ## 5 f 6 ## 6 g 7 ## 7 h 8 ## 8 i 9 Alternatively, you could write a data frame directly like this:\n1 2 3 4 df1 = pd.DataFrame({\u0026#39;x\u0026#39; : [1., 2., 3., 4.], \u0026#39;y\u0026#39; : [4., 3., 2., 1.], \u0026#39;z\u0026#39; : [1, 2, 3, 4]}) df1 1 2 3 4 5 ## x y z ## 0 1.0 4.0 1 ## 1 2.0 3.0 2 ## 2 3.0 2.0 3 ## 3 4.0 1.0 4 Data frames are a VERY powerful data type in Python.

This is a basic plotting package, but does have limitations.\nIf you are familiar with R, you may have used ggplot2 before. In Python, the equivalent package would be Altair. We will take a look at some basic Altair plotting tools.\nLet’s switch things up now and use a different data set to visualize. Like R, Python has a few built-in data sets.

Without anything added, R is a base version. It can do basic calculations, but it requires extra efforts to do more complicated things. People have created extras or add-ons to help create shortcuts for more complicated specific tasks or functions. These \u0026lsquo;add-ons\u0026rsquo; are called packages. Packages can be imported to use to help make things easier. For example, there is a large package in R called tidyverse that is very popular.\nFirst, packages must be installed, and then they have to be called. To install a package, use the command install.packages('package_name'). To call a package, use the command library(package_name). This is one example below:\n1 2 #install.packages(\u0026#39;matlib\u0026#39;) library(matlib) Once a package has been called, it does not need to be called again for the rest of this document. You can also import multiple packages within the same document. We will get into more useful packages later on!\nFor now, practice typing basic calculations into your R terminal to get used to the syntax, and see how easy it is to calculate things!\n","date":"2023-06-14T09:00:00-08:00","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/csc-blog-new/p/introduction-to-r/","title":"Introduction to R"},{"content":"Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computing platform, and it can be used for many things, aside from Python. You can even use both R and Python within the same document.\nThink of Python (or R) as the language you are writing in, and Jupyter as the pen and pencil. This is how Python and Jupyter are used together.\nNote: There are many different IDEs (integrated development environment) for Python. To name a few, Programiz, Atom, Visual Studio Code, Spyder, and many more. If a Jupyter install is causing trouble, or if you do not like the interface and want something similar to R Studio, Spyder is a good option because it is a very familiar interface for R Studio users. Programiz is also great because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t require an install.\nSyzygy Syzygy (pronunciation up for debate) is a great way to use Jupyter without having to download it to your local computer. However, it does require your UBC login to use. It also can access your local files as well as UBC OneDrive files. To use, simply follow this link, click the sign on button in the top right, and use your UBC login to sign in. You will be able to creat files, view existing files, and enjoy all of the functionalities that Jupyter has to offer.\nDownloading Jupyter If you prefer to download Jupyter, it can be done with Anaconda. This video is a great resource explaining how to download both Jupyter and Anaconda, as well as how to get started using Jupyter.\nAlternatively, you can follow the instructions on this webpage to do the same install. Note that it has slightly different instructions for Windows and Mac users.\n","date":"2023-06-05T18:00:00-08:00","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/csc-blog-new/p/jupyter-notebook/","title":"Jupyter Notebook"},{"content":"CSV File Using the Pandas library, it is very easy to open a CSV file using Python. Simply import the package, and then use the line pd.read_csv(). See this example below:\n1 2 import pandas as pd df = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;file.csv\u0026#34;) Note that this assumes the file you want to open follows the same filepath as your current directory. If you wanted to use a file in a different directory, simply use pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;/Users/name/rest_of_filepath/file.csv\u0026quot;) instead.\nAlternatively, if you were to use base Python, it gets a bit more complicated. Using the CSV library, it would have to be done by iterating through each row in the file. Printing each row would look like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 import csv with open(\u0026#34;file.csv\u0026#34;, \u0026#39;r\u0026#39;) as file: csvreader = csv.reader(file) for row in csvreader: print(row) 1 2 3 4 5 ## [\u0026#39;12\\t12\u0026#39;] ## [\u0026#39;34\\t1\u0026#39;] ## [\u0026#39;1\\t1\u0026#39;] ## [\u0026#39;1\\t1\u0026#39;] ## [\u0026#39;1\\t1\u0026#39;] Text File Similarly, for a text file, we can use Pandas to simplify the process. We can use the line pd.read_fwf() to read in a .txt file. For reference, FWF stands for fixed width lines which allows the lengths and features of the file to be specified as fixed values so that it can be read in to Python systematically. See this example below:\n1 2 import pandas as pd df = pd.read_fwf(\u0026#39;file.txt\u0026#39;) Alternatively, you can also iterate through each row similar to the csv format mentioned above, but we will not go through that. If you would like to try it as an exercise, simply use the second method above in the CSV section and change the file formatting to fit a .txt file.\nURL You can also access data on the internet without having to save a local copy. Take this website for example: Gapminder Data\nIf you follow the link, you will see that it is simply a CSV file with no other formatting or permissions to enter. If we wanted to read this into our Python script, we could do it like this:\n1 2 3 import pandas as pd url = \u0026#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jstaf/gapminder/master/gapminder/gapminder.csv\u0026#39; df = pd.read_csv(url) There are many other file formats and ways to load files into Python.

Each of the functions can also copy the files that matched the pattern argument to a new folder (if copy = TRUE, but it is FALSE by default). You can decide which folder the files get copied to using the folder argument.

The simplest data structure in R is a vector. Vectors are one-dimensional arrays (i.e., sets of values) of a single class (such as characters, numbers, dates, etc.), and they have a similar structure to the mathematical concept of vectors. For example, the vector $\\vec v$ with values 1, 4, 6, 2 would be:\n$$\\vec v = \\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 2\\end{bmatrix}.$$In R we can create vectors using the c() function, as follows:\n1 2 v \u0026lt;- c(1, 4, 6, 2) v 1 ## [1] 1 4 6 2 (R prints vectors in a line rather than as columns to improve readability.)\nSince vectors can only contain elements of a common type, c() will force all elements to be of a single class. In the example below, I create a vector with the number 1, the letter \u0026ldquo;a\u0026rdquo;, today\u0026rsquo;s date, and the value TRUE (a boolean value), but c() coerces all values to be characters:\n1 c(1, \u0026#39;a\u0026#39;, Sys.Date(), TRUE) 1 ## [1] \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; \u0026#34;a\u0026#34; \u0026#34;20185\u0026#34; \u0026#34;TRUE\u0026#34; If we place two vectors (of the same class) side by side, we can create a matrix.

People have created extras or add-ons to help create shortcuts for more complicated specific tasks or functions. These \u0026lsquo;add-ons\u0026rsquo; are called packages. Packages can be imported to use to help make things easier. For example, there is a Python package called math that helps with basic mathematical operations. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at an example here of calling the package using the import command.\n1 2 import math math.sqrt(9) 1 ## 3.0 Once it has been imported, it does not need to be re-imported for the rest of this document. You can also import multiple packages within the same document.

We can do this by specifying the shape argument.
